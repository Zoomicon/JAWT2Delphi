# JAWT2Delphi
JAWT2Delphi is a port of the JAWT (Java AWT Native Interface) of JDK1.3RC1 from C to Object Pascal / Delphi

Makes use of *jni.h* from *JNIWrapper* of jrevusky @ bigfoot.com (Crystalline Solutions) 
(original JNI.h is included in the zip file)

Included in the download is sample code from "JavaWorld Tip #86" article, ported from C/JAWT to Delphi/JAWT2Delphi
